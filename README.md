# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

My final year BCA project titled "Twitter Sentiment Analysis" at Amity University, Maharashtra.

This project dives deep into the world of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to analyze public sentiment on Twitter. With millions of tweets generated daily, social media provides an incredible source of public opinionâ€”and this project aimed to make sense of it using a mix of traditional and modern AI techniques.

Key Points:
Built models using Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, SVM), Deep Learning (LSTM), and Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa).
Pre-processed real-world Twitter datasets including data on PM Narendra Modi and U.S. airline sentiment.
Achieved impressive accuracy scores:
- BERT: 97.61%
- RoBERTa: 94.19%
- SVM: 85.47%
- LSTM: 83.71%
- Naive Bayes: 74.25%
Used Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face libraries for model development and evaluation.

Results: The project demonstrated that advanced Transformer models like BERT significantly outperform traditional approaches in sentiment classification tasks. However, simpler models like SVM and LSTM still provide robust, efficient solutions with less computational demand.

Future Works: Future enhancements include multilingual sentiment analysis (supporting Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) and real-time tweet classification for business intelligence and public opinion monitoring.

This project has not only sharpened my technical skills in NLP and ML but has also strengthened my passion for data science and real-world problem-solving.
